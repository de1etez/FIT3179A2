      <p>
        The Winter Olympic Games, also known as the Winter Olympics and the
        Winter Olympics, are the Olympic Games for winter sports, held every
        four years, with the main feature of the event being winter sports held
        on ice and snow, such as ice skating and skiing, which are suitable for
        winter. The XXIV Olympic Winter Games, also known as the 2022 Winter
        Olympics, take place in Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of
        China, from February 4 to February 20, 2022. The data shows, the
        distribution of athletes from different regions, the distribution of
        sports and the ratio of men to women in the sports and the ranking of
        national teams in terms of the number of medals.

          This is an intuitive map of the distribution of athletes participating in the 2022 Winter Olympics. 
          We can see that the distribution of athletes is uneven, with developed countries occupying the majority of athletes. 
          Among them, the United States has become the country with the largest number of participating athletes, as high as 225.

          The pie chart shows the approximate percentage of participants in the different events, 
          with the largest number of participants being ice honkey at 547.

        <p>Through dot plot, We can find the Nordic Combined as an extreme sport, there are no female at 
          all in this event to participate in this project. At the same time ice honkey as the largest number of 
          male and female athletes to participate in the project, they also have the largest difference in 
          the number of male athletes than female athletes up to 311.

          The stacked bar chart displays the total number of medals the country
          team has won, broke down into gold, silver and bronze medal tallies.
          In terms of total, Norway, ROC, and Germany were the top three in
          terms of total medals.

          The heat map shows that we can find the ability of each national team to 
          acquire different medals. Surprisingly, China is in third place with 9 gold medals. 
          This is despite the fact that it is in the middle of the total. The top three places 
          in the total number of gold medals were won by Norway, Germany and China. At the same 
          time it can be seen that ROC, for example, is second in the medal table as a total, 
          but most of them are silver (12) and bronze (14), with a low number of gold medals. 
          Similarly, Canada has a high number of 14 bronze medals.

      <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout the Winter Olympics, athletes are not evenly distributed, mainly in developed countries. 
          The distribution of men and women was also uneven, with more male than female athletes in any event. 
          Because of the large number of participants from developed countries, most of the medals were won by 
          developed countries. Although developing countries like China won 9 gold medals, the overall number 
          is still behind the developed countries, and perhaps more resources need to be invested in the athletes 
          to get better results.
